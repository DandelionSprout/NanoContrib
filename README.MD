## Placeholder Buster

Removes empty ads placeholders. [Subscribe](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https%3A%2F%2Fgitcdn.xyz%2Frepo%2FNanoAdblockerLab%2FNanoContrib%2Fmaster%2Fdist%2Fplaceholder-buster.txt&title=Nano%20Contrib%20Filters%20-%20Placeholder%20Buster)

Notes about Placeholder Buster:

* Most regional lists in Nano Adblocker and uBlock Origin, have lower tresholds for removing empty boxes than what international lists have. As such, end-users visiting specific-language sites should try out such lists, while contributors to this list should have the relevant lists turned on when looking for empty boxes on non-English-language sites.
* Example pages for all new entries are mandatory.
* Adding generic entries is strongly discouraged.
* Run-of-the-mill listmaker customs should be followed (e.g. using `"` in all `[text="text"]` sections; adding `;` at the end of `:style` entries), although this can be fixed with ease if you forget it.
* For removing empty social network box placeholders, go to [the bottom of AdGuard Annoyances Filter's remains subcategory](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/AnnoyancesFilter/sections/remains.txt) (Not officially supported by NanoContrib).
* For removing padding lines that never held anything in the first place, go to Dandelion Sprout's [Empty Padding Remover](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/EmptyPaddingRemover.txt) (Also not officially supported by NanoContrib).
